## Krewes
### TK
`The Main Krewe`
<br>
Formed by our main character and his girlfriend, TK exists solely to be a Krewe for Miiet to take the Draco's Meteor. The Krewe has an interesting line up of people all players recognize such as the Director's little brother Kat and The Tarnished One.

### Black Rose
`AKA The Goths`
<br>
Lead by Rina Woods
<br>
Black Rose is a newer and thus weaker Krewe. They can be found lurking around the drama room. Their Krewe was founded by one of former Queen Aylanna's best friends, Rina who ended up getting a lot of Royals support.

### Class 1A
`AKA The Weebs`
<br>
Lead by Emmanual “King” Peterson
<br>
Class 1A is a weird name for a Krewe but it makes sense considering how tight-knit this Krewe is. While they don’t have nearly as much control over the school as the Royals they still have a King. Their leader Emmanual or as his Krewe refers to him, King, is very popular in his Krewe due to his extensive knowledge of Anime. They can be found in the Art Room, usually discussing or watching anime.

### Shadist
`AKA The Loners`
<br>
Lead by Mira (Last Name unknown)
<br>
The Shadist’s Motto is “Lets Be Alone Together” which is how they attract so many loners. Their Krewe consists of the socially awkward and the quiet kids. Some of these kids would probably be school shooters without their Krewe. They have a reputation for being invisible, making their attacks extremely effective. They can be found just about anywhere but their leader basically lives in the Library.

### Intellos (In-Tell-Os)
`AKA the Nerds`
<br>
Lead by Andrew Walker
<br>
Intellos was originally a study group. However their strong leadership led to the creation of a de facto group. They’re close with the Shadist as many of their members were originally from that krewe however outside of that, they’re pretty closed off. They can be found roaming around the Lecture Hall. They used to be close with Class 1A but a lot of bad things happened that basically ruined that relationship for a while.

### The Justice Party
`AKA the Drama Kids`
<br>
Lead by Apollo Wright
<br>
Apollo is the captain of the rather large debate team. He’s an icon in the school, a clear contender for a possible Royal. However he turned down an invite to join them and opted to start the “Debate Krewe” which was quickly renamed to the Justice Party after Vivian stepped in. Together, Apollo and Vivian run one of the most powerful Krewes, residing in the Debate Room.

### Alegro
`AKA the Band Kids`
<br>
Lead by Jamari Green
<br>
The band kids often refer to themselves as a family. After all they are the most organized Krewe, according to Draco himself. They are led by their drum major Jamari. They usually aren’t the ones to start fights but mess with them and you’ll wish you didn’t. They can be found in the band room however they often roam around the building and are quite friendly. However when they fight they can be brutal killers.

### The Royals
`AKA the Popular Kids`
<br>
Lead by Lydia Brown
<br>
If Allegro has a pseudo family then the Royal are a family. They control most of the school and everyone wants to be them. They aren’t very friendly and are an invite only group. They’re the biggest threat to anyone looking to get their hands on Draco’s Meteor, especially considering Lydia's boyfriend is none other than Draco himself. They’re often found in the cafeteria or in the halls wandering around, never in class except when they feel like it. They have beef with just about anyone that doesn’t like them but they’re never unwilling to fight to earn the respect of their peers.
